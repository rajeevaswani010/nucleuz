### Important instructions to deploy project after cloning laravel repository first time

.env file is required to deploy laravel project..  run below command in home dir

$ cp env .env

.env file is with default laravel configuration.. make changes as per your requirement.. Never commit this to git.


Vendor folder is not part of git. When first time you clone project.. kindly run below commands after creating env file.


$ composer update

$ composer install

Above two commands will create the vendor folder and autoload.php for app to start.


update database credentials in config/database.php

$vim config/database.php 
<< Verify database name, user and password are correct >>>

Test with serve command is server is coming up.

$ php artisan serve



Database versioning
===================
Fixes will require database schema changes sometime.. to track that db_version table is created and will be maintained. check current database version using below command.

$ USER=root; PASSWORD=root;DB=table_car_rental; mysql -u $USER -p$PASSWORD $DB -e "select * from db_version order by db_id DESC limit 1 ;"

Every time update sql file is created dont forget to update this table also.. 


Creating package   (below command will create pkg.zip in one step outside current directory)
=======================================
$ zip -r ../pkg_`date "+%H%M%S_%d%m%Y"`.zip *

Copy abpve pkg.zip to public_html folder on host server.
Uncompress it.
